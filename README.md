# week-9-Professional-README-Generator-ts

Introduction to Node.js

## Description

The Professional README Generator challenge was completed as a starting point in the exploration of back-end web development. 
The application allows users to create a professional README for a project of their choice by communicating via the command line. 
User input is gathered and used to generate a README.md file. 

Completing this project allowed for a basic understanding of runtime environments such as Node.js. 
Building on the knowledge gained previously from using JavaScript in front-end web development, completing the project also allowed for an understanding of the ways in which JavaScript can be used to create applications outside of the browser. 

Other key learning topics include the node package manager and the way in which it efficiently handles the installation of various packages, as well as file systems and modules.
